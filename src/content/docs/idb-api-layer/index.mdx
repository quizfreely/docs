description: Docs for Quizfreely's IndexedDB API Layer
---

Quizfreely's web app needs to query our backend API to query/store/interact with users' data.

Users who don't create an account can still use Quizfreely, but their studysets & data are stored locally in their browsers, not on Quizfreely's servers or through Quizfreely's backend API.

Quizfreely's web app uses IndexedDB to store local data. This API layer thing makes it easy to query/interact with data from IndexedDB the same way the web-app queries the backend API to interact with the database on our server.
